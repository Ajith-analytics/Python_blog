          <p>Missing Values Analysis:
            The percentage of missing data in each column was calculated:
            Camera has about 7.7% missing data.
            Columns like "Actual price" and "Discount price" have minor missing values (around 2.4% and 0.4%, respectively).</p>  
          <p>Data Types:
            The data types of the columns were identified:
            Most columns are of type object (string), while numeric columns like "Actual price," "Discount price," "Stars," and "Display Size (inch)" are of type float64.</p>
          <p>Value Counts:
            The Product Name column has the most frequent product being "OPPO K12x 5G with 45W SUPERVOOC Charger In-The-Box (Breeze Blue, 256 GB)" (31 entries).
