With over three years of experience in the retail industry, I’ve honed my skills in Advanced Excel, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL, and have successfully led strategic projects that drive business growth and operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>My expertise lies in transforming complex data into actionable insights, optimizing processes, and effectively managing stakeholders to achieve business objectives. I am particularly passionate about leveraging machine learning techniques to solve business problems and improve decision-making.</p>
          <p>Throughout my career, I’ve played a pivotal role in achieving sales targets, managing inventory, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver impactful solutions. My hands-on experience in sales data analytics and project management allows me to approach challenges with a strategic mindset and a focus on continuous improvement.</p> 
          <p>As I continue to grow in my career, I am eager to take on new challenges that push the boundaries of data-driven decision-making and process optimization. I am also pursuing a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certification to further enhance my ability to deliver value to organizations.</p>
